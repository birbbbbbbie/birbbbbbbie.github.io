It is really important for us to cultivate an excitement towards robotics in younger children, as it will allow them to continue pursuing their passion as they mature. Having a fundamental knowledge towards mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer aided drafting (CAD), and computer science will help boost them ahead of their peers and help them gain confidence in the STEM world.<br> &emsp;Especially within the last year, we have prioritized bringing FIRST to the local community. Our most recent FLL tournament took place on 10/26/19 at the Walnut Teen Center. 17 FLL teams participated and 38 volunteers helped run it. The event was a success and we look forward to hosting future tournaments so that we can not only encourage others to pursue FIRST, but to also get to know members in our community and create lasting bonds. </p></div>

After months of planning, Kenneth and some of his friends in Anloga, Ghana created a program that would eventually touch thousands of young lives in Anloga. His program was built to mentor a group of kids at the Avete Anloga Basic School and train them to be a competing FLL team.  Each year, Walnut Valley Robotics send a few high school members to Ghana to help teach these students. They bring with them LEGO materials, computers, and a new possibility for every child. <br>  &emsp;Avete Anloga Basic School now has 9 LEGO Mindstorm Kits, 13 computers, and a fully functioning FLL team.  Their team is going to compete in December at their national capitol for a chance to qualify for World Championships in Houston, Texas.</p></div>

Each year, we try to bring something different to interact with our audience. This past year, our team was able to construct a mechanized pong table. Fair goers were able to play a unique game of ping pong—instead of using traditional paddles to hit the ball back and forth, they were able to control the game using an Xbox controller. The controllers connected to a gear that moved the paddle left and right. Safe to say, it was a hit and we were able to show spectators and players alike the amazing things that can be done with STEM.<br> &emsp;On December 14, 2019, we were invited to attend the NATS Children’s Day.  We displayed our 2019 Offseason Robot, made a few demos, and also participated in a Q&A session.</p></div>
